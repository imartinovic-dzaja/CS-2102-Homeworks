Problem Description and Context
Many competitions are played as a collection of matches or contests between either individual players or teams.
 In this assignment, we will use Java to model and implement programs over single matches.

Each match involves two contestants and contains the results (the scores for each contestant). 
The details of contestants and scores differ across kinds of contests 
(sports, quiz shows, robot battles, etc), but the structure of a match does not.

For this assignment, we will consider two kinds of contestants:

In the Rugby World Cup, contestants are teams, each of which represents a country and wears a 
specific jersey color. A team may or may not have a formal intimidation ritual at the start of 
each match (this is a reference to the haka (Links to an external site.), the traditional pre-match 
ritual by the New Zealand team); just use a boolean to record whether a team has such a ritual. 
Each team has a certain number of wins and losses for the season.

Robotics competitions also feature teams. Each team comes from a particular school and competes 
with a robot that has some special feature (such as a powerful arm or the ability to spray water, 
which we describe as a string). We also care about the previous score that the team had in their 
last competition (using 0 if a team has never competed before).

The results of a match consist of the two teams and the scores for each contestant. 
For purposes of this assignment, the following information makes up the score for a 
contestant in each kind of event:

A rugby score is just the number of points scored.

A robotics score contains a number of points, a number of attempted tasks, and an indication of whether the 
robot fell down during the competition.

Programming Problems
1. 	Develop Java class and interface definitions to capture matches, contestants, and scores as described above. 
	Your data should capture all of the italicized concepts from the description. 
	You should have one match definition that can capture each of Rugby and Robotics matches, 
	but different definitions for each kind of contestant and score.

	In order to let us run tests against your code, everyone needs to use standard names for interfaces 
	and classes. Use the following:

IContestant and IResult for interfaces
Match for the match class

RugbyTeam and RoboticsTeam for the contestant classes

RugbyResult and RoboticsResult for the results classes

	You may structure the fields of the results classes however you wish, 
	but your results-class constructors should take all of the components of the results for both players. 
	This means that, in addition to the two teams, the RugbyResult constructor should take two numbers 
	(the points for each team) and the RoboticsResult constructor should have six numbers:

  RugbyResult(RugbyTeam team1, RugbyTeam team2, double team1points, double team2point) {
     ...
  }

  RoboticsResult(RoboticsTeam team1, RoboticsTeam team2, 
                 double team1points, int team1tasks, boolean team1fell,
                 double team2points, int team2tasks, boolean team2fell) {
     ...
  }
2. 	Write a method isValid in each results class that determines whether the results are expected or 
	reasonable  according to the individual score components. For rugby scores, a result is valid only if 
	BOTH teams are under 150 points. For robotics scores, a result is valid only if BOTH teams have fewer 
	than 8 attempted tasks AND no more than 16 points.

3. Write a method getScore in RoboticsResult that takes in the number of points, the number of tasks, 
	and whether the robot fell down. It calculates a final score by summing the points and tasks and then 
	applying a 5 point deduction if the robot fell down.

4. 	Write a method winner in the Match class that returns the contestant that won the match according to
  	the results. You may assume that there are no matches with ties. The winner of a Rugby match is the
  	team with more points. The winner of a robotics contest is the one with the highest score calculated 
  	using the method in the previous step. If the results are invalid, however, the method returns null.

	To make winner work, write a common method called getWinner in both results classes and then make it 
	available through the IResult interface. You will then have to call getWinner and isValid in your winner 
	method.

5.	Write a method expectToBeat in each contestant class that takes another contestant as input and returns 
	a boolean indicating whether the contestant would be expected to win against the given/input contestant. 
	For a rugby match, if only one team has an intimidation ritual, that team is the expected winner; 
	if neither or both teams have such rituals, the expected winner is the one with the bigger gap between 
	number of wins and number of losses (i.e. the team for whom the value of [number of wins - number of 
	losses] is higher). The expected winner of a robotics competition is the one with a higher previous 
	score, i.e. a higher value in the "previous score" field. If there is no clear expected winner, 
	return false. You do not need to put this method in your IContestant interface.

6. 	Create a test suite for your work. Put all of your tests and test data in a class called Examples. 
	Your class must be called this so that the auto-grader can find it!
	Note on testing Doubles: When you want to use assertEquals to compare doubles, you include a 
	third argument which is the allowable difference between the two values for them to still be 
	considered equal. For example:

      assertEquals(5.0, 4.995, .01)
	returns true. Doubles can be imprecise due to the way they are represented within the computer, 
	hence the need for this third argument.
	Note on Writing Tests that Compare Objects: A subtlety to JUnit (that we will talk about next week) 
	affects how you write tests that compare objects. When writing these tests, name the objects and use 
	the names in the assertEquals test. For instance, let's say we have a hypothetical class called 
	ShootingResult that contains a hypothetical method called bestRound() that returns a ShootingRound:

      public class Examples {

        ShootingRound longRound = new ShootingRound(...);
        ShootingResult goodResult = new ShootingResult(... longRound ...);

        ...

        @Test
        public void testLongBest() {
          assertEquals(longRound, goodResult.bestRound());
        }
      }
	You should NOT make a new ShootingRound for the expected answer in the assertEquals. Such a test would fail,
 	even if the two rounds had the same contents (again, for reasons we will explain in detail in week 2).
	Just because your program passes all of your JUnit tests does not guarantee that it will pass all of ours.
	However, you can minimize the risk that your methods will fail our JUnit tests by sticking with the
	proper naming conventions and writing as many edge cases as possible. The more testing you do, the less 
	the likelihood of failure!
